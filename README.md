### For execution, simply go to the one of the demo folders ('Demo_Alzheimer', 'Demo_mediumDatasets', or 'Demo_smallDatasets'), and open '.m' file in MATLAB and execute that. All source codes and datases are available in 'src' folder.

### These codes contains implementation of the following papers:
